## Work in progress. Nothing functional.

Plan:

- This is all unofficial and only serves as a educational hack.
- I only plan to implement part of the API.
- Official SDK will probably be released in the future.
- Based on [developer guide](https://mega.co.nz/#developers) and site source.
- Crypto is mostly ported from browser code and isn't optimal. Probably some of it could be done with openssl, [ursa](https://github.com/Obvious/ursa) or [cryptojs](https://github.com/gwjjeff/cryptojs.git) or the algorithms could at least be ported to use Buffer format, but this is no way a priority.
- If you use it for something make sure you agree with Mega's [Terms of Service](https://mega.co.nz/#terms).
